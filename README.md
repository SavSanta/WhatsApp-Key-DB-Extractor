## PREREQUISITES:
 1. O/S: Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac OS X or Linux  
 2. Java - If not installed: https://www.java.com/en/download/  
 3. ADB (Android Debug Bridge) Drivers: https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools
 4. USB Debugging must be enabled on the target device. Settings -> Developer Options -> (Debugging) USB debugging  
     If you cannot find Developer Options then please go to: Settings -> About phone/device and tap the Build number  
     multiple times until you're finally declared a developer.  
 5. Android device running version 4.0 or higher, but lower than Android 14.


## INSTRUCTIONS:
 1. Extract "WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor-master.zip" maintaining the directory structure.  
 2. Click on "WhatsAppKeyDBExtract.bat" (Windows) or "WhatsAppKeyDBExtract.sh" (Mac OS X / Linux).  
 3. Connect your device via USB, unlock your screen and wait for "Full backup" or the permission request screen to appear.  
 4. Enter your backup password or leave blank (if none set) and tap on "Back up my data".  
 5. Confirm backup password in your command console and then check your "extracted" folder.  
 

## TROUBLESHOOTING:
 1. If you have never used USB Debugging before, you may also need to verify the fingerprint.  
 2. If you have set a default backup password in your Android settings, then this MUST be the  
     backup password that you PROVIDE when prompted to backup your data. Else it WILL fail!  
 3. Linux and Mac OS X users may need to set the script permissions as executable. Depending on the  
     adb permissions, you may also need to "sudo ./WhatsAppKeyDBExtract.sh" from your command console.  
 4. If you're having issues with "WhatsAppKeyDBExtract.bat" then right click "WhatsAppKeyDBExtract.ps1"  
     and select "Run with PowerShell". You may have to enter "y" at first run for execution policy.  
 5. If you get an error saying "AES encryption not allowed" then you need to update your Oracle Java  
    Cryptography Extension (JCE) to Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.
